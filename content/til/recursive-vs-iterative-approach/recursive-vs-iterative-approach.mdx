There's a reason why React is moving toward a linked list approach and moving away
the recursive approach used in the current reconciler.

Recursion requires an O(n) call stack (causes jank). But if you do things
iteratively, you can stop relying on stacks and push all object references into the heap. Arguably this is harder to reason about and harder to understand but the perf gains are totally worth it.
