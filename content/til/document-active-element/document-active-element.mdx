If you want to know what element on the page currently has focus, you can use
`document.activeElement` to get access to the reference of the currently focused
element.

I'm using it to handle the `/` key to force my website to move focus onto the search input
(similar to what github does) and to not try to make the site refocus the search if is
the currently active element.
