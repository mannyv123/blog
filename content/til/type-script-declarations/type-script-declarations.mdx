import { MDXTextLink as TextLink } from "../../../src/components/mdx-comps"

My senior Danny taught me today about how to easily create declaration files in components.

Rather than exporting interfaces in a component, you can set up a `typings.d.ts` inside of a directory
and it will be available in the scope of any files in that directory. 😁

```
GeneralComponent
|--> GeneralComponent.tsx
|--> typings.d.ts
|--> Specialized // has access to interfaces in typings
     |---> Specialized.tsx
     |---> __tests__
```
