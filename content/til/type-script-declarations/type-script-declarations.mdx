import { MDXTextLink as TextLink } from "../../../src/components/mdx-comps"

My colleague Danny taught me how to easily create exportable interfaces for react components.

Rather than exporting interfaces in a component (imperatively), you can set up a `typings.d.ts` inside of a directory
and it will be available to all components that reside in subdirectories. 😁

```
GeneralComponent
|--> GeneralComponent.tsx
|--> typings.d.ts
|--> Specialized // has access to interfaces in typings
     |---> Specialized.tsx
     |---> __tests__
```

Another valid way to do things is split typings in this way.

```
src/types
|--> canvas.d.ts
|--> interfaces.d.ts
```
