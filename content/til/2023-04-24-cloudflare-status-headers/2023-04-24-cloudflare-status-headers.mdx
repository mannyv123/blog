So I've been trying to add in some `cache-control` headers to my remix site and I'm using cloudflare as my CDN.

In order to determine if the cache is being hit, cloudflare adds a `cf-cache-status` header to the response. 
This is great, but I can't seem to find any documentation on what the possible values are. However, I did
find a blog post that explains these values.
