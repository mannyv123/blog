I haven't used this yet and today I didn't have much going on as I had to work
on some stuff around the house (renovations and all) but there's an

<TextLink href="https://github.com/Idered/twix">project</TextLink> that tries to
make it a little bit more ergonomic to work with tailwind and React ðŸ˜Š.
