Alright, I'm not the greatest at CSS, but I respect those people, such as `Josh Comeau` that are! TIL (from reading his blog post) 
the following about some CSS attributes and how they relate to grid: 

- `justify`: deals with *columns*
- `align`: deals with *rows*
- `content`: deals with the *grid struture*
- `items`: deals with the *DOM nodes* within the grid structure

For example, `align-items: center` can loosely be translated into: `In the context of the row, these DOM nodes, center them... bro`. 
Seriously, go read his article.
