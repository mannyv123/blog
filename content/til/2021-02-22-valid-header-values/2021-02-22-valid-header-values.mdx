Turns out header values are always strings. So if there's a header value like x-header and you want
to see if it is true or false in JS, doing Boolean(req.header['x-header']) would be `true` regardless because
"true" and "false" are both true for `Boolean` constructor. 

You can do something like req.header['x-header'] === 'true'
