import { TextLink } from "../../../src/components/mdx-comps";

99% of the time you want to be using `useEffect` but there are some rare use cases
for `useLayoutEffect` and I incidentally ran into one today at work ðŸ˜‚.

- `useLayoutEffect` if you need to mutate the DOM and/or perform some measurements
- `useEffect` if you don't interact with the DOM at all.
