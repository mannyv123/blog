So Scala is a single inheritance language but allows classes to utilize multiple traits (these are like interfaces in Java).
`Traits` and `Abstract` classes in Scala are essentially the same but there are some key differences.

1. Traits cannot have constructor parameters (you can't do a new trait)
2. A class can inherit from multiple traits.
3. Traits are for behaviors. Abstract classes are for things.
