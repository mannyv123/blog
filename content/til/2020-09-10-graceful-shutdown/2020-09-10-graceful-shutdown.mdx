Basically, avoid having to do any major logic from the _SIGTERM_ signal or any
other EXIT signals in node because they can often times be fired twice. It's
much better to run any clean up code that you want in the start of the process
versus the end.

Also check out **death** on npm. It's a handy helper library.
