State management is hard but there's a difference between state management in our apps
versus managing our app's server cache. Luckily, there are two libraries that we can use
to help us with our server side state needs.

React query and RTK Query. We're using React Query at work but RTK query looks cool too!

I'll probably do a small POC this weekend to get a feel for the ergonomics.
