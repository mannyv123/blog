If you're rendering over 50 rows in react-table and messing around with complicated
filter logic, it's wise to utilize something like `react-window` to get some performance gains
as users are not going to be interacting with elements not in the viewport so we shouldn't
tax them for the rendering costs behind such frivolous elements.
