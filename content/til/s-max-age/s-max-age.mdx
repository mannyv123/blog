import { TextLink } from "../../../src/components/mdx-comps";

TIL that there is a cache control header for a shared cache. The **s-max-age**
is similar to the **max-age** in that they both set a timer to invalidate a cache
for a particular resource. The difference between the two is that the **s-max-age**
applies to **shared** content and therefore applies to content on a CDN.

This is better in circumstances where we want to force an invalidation for a particular resource.
This is not possible with **max-age**.
