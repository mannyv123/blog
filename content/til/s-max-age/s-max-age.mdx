TIL that there is a cache control header for a shared cache. The _s-max-age_
is similar to the _max-age_ in that they both set a timer to invalidate a cache
for a particular resource. The difference between the two is that the _s-max-age_
applies to _shared_ content and therefore applies to content on a CDN.

This is better in circumstances where we want to force an invalidation for a particular resource.
This is not possible with _max-age_.
