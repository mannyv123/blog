import { MDXTextLink as TextLink } from "../../../src/components/mdx-comps"

Ever run into the problem of having your `__tests__` directory sit outside of your `src` and this in turn causing issues with TypeScript?
I'm a big fan of colocating tests but if you're ever working on a codebase that doesn't embrace this philosophy and instead has a `__tests__` directory that sits
at the same level as `src`, you may need a a separate `tsconfig` for your tests.

This is possible thanks to the `-p` flag in TS and the fact that we can `extend` tsconfig files. For the project in question,
we used:

1. tsconfig.json
2. tsconfig.build.json
3. tsconfig.test.json
