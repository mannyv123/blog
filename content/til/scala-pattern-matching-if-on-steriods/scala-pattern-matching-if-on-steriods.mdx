Pattern matching in Scala allows us to do some very nifty things. This is all possible
due to the fact that the comparison of objects is not done at the reference level but at the value level.

Refer to the TIL regarding Scala's case classes😁.

```Scala
case class Cat(color: String, food: String)

val oswald = Cat("black", "Chips")

object ChipShop {
  def willServe(c: Cat): Boolean = {
    c match {
      case Cat(_, "Chips") => true //don't care about the first argument
      case Cat(_, _) => false // don't care about any arguments (this is the default case essentially)
    }
  }
}

ChipShop.willServe(oswald) // true
```

A pattern can be one of

1. a name, binding any value to that name;
2. an underscore, matching any value and ignoring it;
3. a literal, matching the value the literal denotes; or
4. a constructor-style pattern for a case class.
