import { MDXTextLink as TextLink } from "../../../src/components/mdx-comps"

TypeScript has a handy utility type to `extract` types from a union type ðŸ¤­.

```tsx
  type MyUnion = "Hello" | "Mom" | "I" | "Love" | "You"
  type WithoutMom = Extract<MyUnion, "Mom">
  // the above will be the type "Hello" | "I" | "Love" | "You"
``
