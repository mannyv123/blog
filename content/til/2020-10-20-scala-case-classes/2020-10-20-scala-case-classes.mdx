Scala `case classes` are the bread and butter of Scala data types! Learn them ye fool.

The syntax is as normal but with a case prefix. By using the `case` word before class,
Scala provides us some functionality out of the box, including but not limited to:

1. the ability to omit the val keyword in constructor calls. (A field for each constructor argument)
2. a nicer toString method for classes
3. a sensible equals which operates on the field values of an object
4. a copy method that creates a new object with the same field values as the current one

```Scala
case class Cat(color: String, food: String)

// vs

class Cat(val color: String, val food: String)
```
