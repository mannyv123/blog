As mentioned in my website's description, this blog is meant to be a home for the **mostly** developer thoughts
that I have... **mostly**! So today, I'm taking a break from tech and I'm going to be talking about mortgages in Canada.

First and foremost, we should give a definition for the word mortgage. This was pulled directly from <TextLink href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp">Investopedia</TextLink>

_A mortgage is a loan that the borrower uses to purchase or maintain a home or
other form of real estate and agrees to pay back over time, typically in a
series of regular payments. The property serves as collateral to secure the
loan._

## Key terms

<DefWrapper>

### Amortization

This is the amount of time it would take for you to pay your mortgage down to a zero balance assuming equal payments.
The most common amortization is 25 years, however with a down payment or equity position of 20% or more, you can go as high as 30 years

### Fixed rate mortgage

This is a mortgage where the interest rate and the payment you'll be making are fixed for the term
of your mortgage agreement. Regardless of what the market does, your payments will not change.
**Preferable to people who are more risk averse.**

### Variable rate mortgage

Unlike a fixed rate mortgage, the payments/interest rate for this mortgage can vary based on the
prime rate set on variable mortgages. The Prime Rate is set by the Bank of Canada.

### Open vs closed mortgage

An open mortgage lets you pay off the entire mortgage at any time during the term without
incurring any penalities. Quite rare as these carry higher interest rates than closed mortgages.
These are most often used when your maturity date is approaching and you have not yet re-signed
with your current lender. Usually happens when the borrower wants to switch lenders but didn't
start the process until last minute (shame shame!).

If you're looking to switch lenders and your maturity date is coming up, **ASK YOUR LENDER and
verify that they will throw you into an open mortgage otherwise you'll have to pay fees for
breaking your closed mortgage.** Some lenders will automatically throw you into a closed mortgage
if they don't hear from you; the jerks.

### Preapproval

This is basically going to a lender and finding out how much of a loan you qualify for. Most realtors
won't even show listings to you until you've done this step since it's unknown how much financing you'll
be able to rally together.

Things that impact your chances of approval include but are not limited to:

1. Thin credit
2. Probationary employment
3. Insufficient employment history
4. Self-employed status

### Stress test

Essentially, in order to protect borrowers from changing interests rate, the Government of Canada
created the idea of a stress test. Rather than using the lenders rate to determine how much an individual would qualify
for in regards to a mortgage, a benchmark rate (which is generally quite a bit higher than the lenders rate) is used to determine
the borrower's qualifying amount.
