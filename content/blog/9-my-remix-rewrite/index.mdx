I've been working on websites for the past 7 years, and throughout those years,
some things has stayed consistent: I've always had a blog and there's always been
something new to learn. Whether or not I've consistenly written content on my blog,  
though, is another story (I haven't); but I've always had one!

Let me walk you through the evolution of my blog, starting from 2015 and how we
ended up here.

## The Why

First and foremost, let's establish why I rewrote my blog (again) in 2023. My
previous iteration was written in <TextLink href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</TextLink>, and I was pretty
happy with it. It was fast, it was easy to write, and it did everything I needed
a basic blog to do.

However, I was starting to get a bit bored of it, Gatsby had fallen out of
favor, I wanted to try something new, and thanks to the massive lay-offs in big
tech, I had some time on my hands ðŸ˜…. Moreover, I'm noticing a shift in the 
FE landscape where the lines between the backend and the frontend are starting to 
get a little bit blurry  so it kinda made sense to pick up a project that would get me 
some exposure ðŸ’¨ -- <TextLink href="https://www.patterns.dev/posts/react-server-components">Enter react server components</TextLink>.
