---

I've been working on websites for the past 7 years, and throughout those years,
some things has stayed consistent: I've always had a blog and there's always been
something new to learn. Whether or not I've consistenly written content on my blog,  
though, is another story (I haven't); but I've always had one!

Let me walk you through the evolution of my blog, starting from 2015 and how we
ended up here.

## The Why

First and foremost, let's establish why I rewrote my blog (again) in 2023. My
previous iteration was written in <TextLink href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</TextLink>, and I was pretty
happy with it. It was fast, it was easy to write, and it did everything I needed
a basic blog to do.

However, I was starting to get a bit bored of it, Gatsby had fallen out of
favor, I wanted to try something new, and thanks to the massive lay-offs in big
tech, I had some time on my hands ðŸ˜…. Moreover, I'm noticing a shift in the 
FE landscape where the lines between the backend and the frontend are starting to 
get a little bit blurry  so it kinda made sense to pick up a project that would get me 
some exposure ðŸ’¨ -- <TextLink href="https://www.patterns.dev/posts/react-server-components">Enter react server components</TextLink>.

## The Evolution

When I first started getting into web development, my first project, like many others who are starting out today was a blog! 
However, back then (circa 2014), I didn't know JavaScript all that well and the JavaScript that I did know was all jQuery. 
Creating a fancy, slick looking site was beyond my abilities and I didn't have all the modern day niceities that we have today 
(tailwind was not a thing, webpack wasn't even on my radar, and don't even get me started on the state of React).

So I did what I could. I started before I was ready and with the tools that I had at my disposable: HTML and CSS. 
My old site is still available and hosted for free at my <TextLink href="https://www.sfu.ca/~tbains/old_site/html/home.html">alma-mater</TextLink>.

It's not much to look at and it's not mobile friendly, but it is one thing for damn sure, besides cringey: performant. 
You can't get much faster than vanilla HTML and css, and it's one of the primary benefits of the <TextLink href="https://jamstack.org/why-jamstack/">Jamstack</TextLink>.
Unlike my second iteration of my blog (which is no longer up), there's also minimal security concerns with these HTML files. 
My old server got hacked and became a zombie sending people spam emails ðŸ˜… because I failed to keep it updated.
