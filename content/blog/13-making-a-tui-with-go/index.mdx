You know the drill; start with why! If you don't know of Simon Sinek's TED talk,
I highly recommend it. It's a great talk that has helped me in many aspects of
my life. So, let's start with why I decided to make a terminal user interface
(TUI) with Go.

The primary reason I made this TUI was because it aligned with my goals for the
year. If you read [my previous blog post](./12-go-htmx-and-lit/), you know that
I'm devoting 2024 to learning Go and trying my best to channel my inner Gopher.
Moreover, I wanted to create a project that would be not only helpful to me but
also to my colleagues. Since I'm an avid `neovim` user, I'm fortunate to be able
to use &nbsp;<TextLink href="https://github.com/jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim">
ChatGPT.nvim</TextLink> while I'm working on features. However, my colleagues
who use `VSCode` don't have the same luxury (yeah yeah, I know they have
copilot, but the neovim plugin just hits different). Beyond those reasons, the
final (some would say superficial) reason is that I wanted to make a TUI because
I thought it would be fun. because AI is the latest buzzword and I wanted to be
part of the hype train ðŸš„.

## What did I make?

I made a TUI that allows you to interact with OpenAI's ChatGPT model. The TUI is
written in Go and is therefore `blazingly fast` (cringed as I typed that ðŸ˜…).
The TUI is a simple interface (because, it's Go, we gotta embrace simplicity)
that allows you to interact with the your chosen model (it defaults to
`chatgpt-3.5-turbo`).

If you want to try it out yourself, you can find the source code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/tearingItUp786/chatgpt-tui)! Now, if you're
wondering what did I use to make this work of art (awh shucks, thanks friend),
fret not friend, I'll tell you (I mean, you can just check out the repo, but
I'll tell you here as well ðŸ˜†).

- [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea): A Go framework for
  terminal user interfaces. It's a great framework that makes it easy to create
  TUIs in Go.
- [openai](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference): OpenAI's REST Api
- [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/): A C library that provides a lightweight
  disk-based database that doesn't require a separate server process (perfect
  for terminal apps, in my opinion).
- [lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss): Style definitions for
  nice terminal layouts!
- [bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles): Some general use
  components for Bubble Tea apps!

## The fun parts

Before I jump into the things that I struggled with (and ultimately learned a
lot about) while developing this application, I want to cover the things that
got me going as I was chugging along with this tui.

First and foremost, I was thrilled to learn more
about&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">The Elm
Architecture</TextLink>. For those of you who aren't familiar, Elm is a
functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript -- wild right. The
Elm Architecture is a pattern that is used to build web applications in Elm
(duh). In short, there are three parts to the Elm Architecture: `Model`, `View`,
and `Update`. The `Model` is the state of the application, the `View` is the way
to turn your state into the UI, and the `Update` is way to update your state
based on messages. You can check out this simple example using the Elm
Architecture in Go
on&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://github.com/tearingItUp786/chatgpt-tui/blob/main/cmd/main.go">Github</TextLink>
;it writes what the user just typed into a `debug.log` file.

Coming from `React`, it was tough to wrap my head around this architecture at
first, but as I worked my way through this project, I started to see the beauty.
Simple, yet elegant. Huge shout out to the one homie on youtube that made a
video on the Elm Architecture in Go; you can watch it below.

<p className="mt-4">
  It wasn't enough to consume the video that I watched above; I had to try and
  reason about what was going on in the code. So, before I even wrote any code,
  I started to create the below mermaid diagram to help me understand how
  exactly I would go about creating the TUI. Now, I want to be clear, I iterated
  on the below diagram quite a bit and it's the _basic_ understanding that I
  arrived at after watching the video and playing around with some bubbletea
  examples. Don't `@` me if it's not perfect ðŸ˜….
