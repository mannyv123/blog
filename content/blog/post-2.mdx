import { TextLink, ShortQuote } from "../../src/utils/styling/typo.js"

Hey y'all (most likely just me) but here's a high level overview of the things I learned from the remote <TextLink href="https://egghead.io">egghead</TextLink> worskhop I attended today.

<TextLink href="https://github.com/chantastic/react-suspense-course">
  Here's a link to the repo
</TextLink>

TLDR;

1. What is React Suspense and why it matters
2. React Suspense -- the meat of the workshop
3. Designing flexible components
4. Nuggets picked up from the workshop

## What is React Suspense and why it matters

## React Suspense -- the meat of the workshop

## Designing flexible components

A big piece of knowledge/wisdom I was able to pick up from this workshop regards components in the post react age.

<ShortQuote>Each component should have one specific intent</ShortQuote>

What this means to me is that a button components intent is to fire off some click event once clicked;
we leave it up to the user of the component to decide what this click event will be. If we abstract this idea out even further,
if we have a component that is responsible for rendering a list of data, we should allow the user of this component to
dictate what the rendering function will look like.

```jsx:title=index.js
import React from "react"
import { PokemonList } from "./PokemonList.js"

function App(props) {
  return (
    <PokemonList
      as="ul"
      renderItem={pokemon => (
        <li key={pokemon.name}>
          <button onClick={() => alert(`You selected ${pokemon.name}`)}>
            {pokemon.name}
          </button>
        </li>
      )}
    />
  )
}
```

```jsx:title=PokemonList.js
import React from "react"
import { unstable_createResource as createResource } from "react-cache"

let PokemonCollection = createResource(() =>
  fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon").then(res => res.json())
)

export function PokemonList({
  as: As = React.Fragment,
  renderItem = pokemon => <div key={pokemon.name}>{pokemon.name}</div>,
}) {
  // highlight-next-line
  return <As>{PokemonCollection.read().results.map(renderItem)}</As>
}
```

## Little nuggets from the workshop

At the end of the workshop, <TextLink>Chantastic</TextLink> invited us all to ask some questions and like most
question and answer segements, this one was ripe with golden nuggets.
The following are 4 libraries that Micahel Chan (Chantastic) recommends to teams he works with:

1. <TextLink href="https://ui.reach.tech/">ReachUI</TextLink>
2. <TextLink>React Router</TextLink>
3. <TextLink href="https://egghead.io/courses/immutable-javascript-data-structures-with-immer">
     Immer
