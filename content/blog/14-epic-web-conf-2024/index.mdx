If you have the opportunity to attend a conference, do it; don't think, just do
it! This year, I had the privilege of
attending&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://www.epicweb.dev/conf">Epic Web
Conference</TextLink>, and it was an amazing experience. From the speakers to
the workshops, everything was well planned and executed. I learned so much and
met so many dope people.

But why'd I go? Kent made the talks available online for free. I could've just
watched the confrence from the comfort of my own home instead of spending money
to travel to beautiful Park City, Utah. Technically true, but there's something
uncanny about being in the same room as the speakers and other attendees. The
vibe, undeniably is different. It's like the difference between watching a
concert on YouTube versus being there in person. The energy is incomparable.

Beyond the difference in experience, Kent's my boy and I wanted to support him.
I was the first person to
buy&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://www.epicweb.dev/buy">Epic Web Dev</TextLink>
and you can bet your bottom dollar I was the first person to buy a ticket out to
Utah! Don't belive me? Check out
this&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://youtu.be/URKySjEq5rk?t=462">clip</TextLink>
from Kent's office hours üòÜ!

## How I prepped

Taran, you _prepped_ for a conference that you were _attending_? Yes, I did.
Yes, you can bet your ass I did! I wanted to make the most of my time at the
conference, so I did the unthinkable... I planned üò±!

<ShortQuote>You get out what you put in</ShortQuote>

Thanks to Kent's brilliant planning, the conference was single track. I didn't
need to need to do much prep work to see which sessions I wanted to attend --
everyone was attending the same sessions -- so I had limited amounts of FOMO
(fear of missing out). I loved this single track idea and yeah, sure, I didn't
necessarily _need_ to watch the presenter introductions before the conference...
but I did, and let me tell you why: I wanted to know a little bit about the
people I was going to meet before I actually met them! Cold approaches suck so
anything that can be done to metaphorically warm up the approach is a good idea
üòÇ.

### My goals for the conference

I was lucky enough to have my employer cover the cost of my ticket for Epic Web
Conference and as such, I had added incentive to set up some goals for the
conference. Even if my employer didn't cover the cost, I would've set up goals
for myself. Here are the goals I set... you may notice a trend üôà:

1. Talk to <TextLink href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds">Kent C.
   Dodds</TextLink>
2. Talk to <TextLink href="https://twitter.com/Madisonkanna">Madison
   Kana</TextLink>
3. Talk to <TextLink href="https://twitter.com/chantastic">Michael
   Chan</TextLink>
4. Talk to <TextLink href="https://twitter.com/ryanflorence">Ryan
   Florence</TextLink>
5. Talk to <TextLink href="https://twitter.com/simonswiss">Simon
   Vrachliotis</TextLink>

üòÖ as you may have noticed, the goals all centered around meeting folks and
talking to them. I had no idea what I was going to say to them, but I knew I
wanted to meet them! I wanted to humanize the people I've been following on
Twitter for ages now because it's so easy to forget that there's a super rad
person behind the screen.

Now, despite being dubbed a social butterfly by my friends, and by a new friend
I made at the conference (my
boy&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://twitter.com/deriegle">Devin</TextLink>), I was
nervous as hell to talk to these folks. I mean, they're like the cool kids in
highschool.

That gif (and that's with a hard g) is a pretty accurate representation of how I
felt lol. However, that framing was terrible! Thank God for Kent and his "you
can sit with us" attitude/t-shirt/sign. Seeing that sign reminded me that these
people are actually really sweet and approachable. They're not the cool kids in
highschool, they're the cool friends on Twitter that you've never met in person.
Those people and everyone else as the conference were
so&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://youtu.be/jjt9Qx9MBPk?t=22">fetch</TextLink> üòÇ!

Also, and this is more of a me thing, something that helped me deal with my
nerves with being in a new place with new people (in the States where the Second
Amendment is a thing), was training some Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I'm not saying
that I was going to use my BJJ skills on anyone at the conference, but doing
this let me get a feel for the people in Park City. I know this is a cliche,
but&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://youtu.be/lPRZE5gJ_Vs?t=109">I really believe
you really get to know someone after having fought them</TextLink>. I got to
_kinda_ know Park City after having a few sparring bouts with my boys from BJJ
Revolution Utah.

## My experience

The conference was amazing. I met so many cool people and learned so much.
That's it. That's the post. Make sure you come in 2025 üòÜ.

### Everyone is a person

I met some of my heroes and "celebrities" in the web development space: Kent C.
Dodds, Una Kravets, Ryan Florence, Michael Chan, Theo. This was hella
intimidating at first. They were "somebodies" and I was a "nobody" -- or at
least that's what imposter syndrome had me thinking. But dude, and hear me out
here... intimidation is _so_ unnecessary when meeting these people! Despite
being "celebrities", they were all so easy to talk to. Hell, Kent upon seeing
me, gave me a big hug; it was so awesome üôèüèΩü§ó!

And you might be thinking, "Taran, of course they're people... everyone is just
a person". But it's easy to forget that when the person you're speaking with is
influential in your field and whose opinion carries weight in the community.
But, again, they're just people. They're just like you and me. The things we
talked about ranged from thoughts on Design Systems and Storybook's place in the
ecosystem, red flags in dating profiles (you're not 5'11" Madison), my awesome
beard, and how
amazing&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://www.inngest.com/">inngest</TextLink> is as
a solution (Jessy was a major hype man for this... but I don't have his twitter
handle üòï).

Not only was it dope meeting my heroes, but it was awesome meeting new friends,
that weren't "famous"! I had a great rapport and coffee session with Devin. We
got into the thick of things, beyond just tech and our palce in the industry,
but things like raising a family, values and morals, and just overall things
beyond tech; it was one of my favorite conversations during my stay in Utah.

## Begin draft section

### Workshops

If your budget allows for it, check them out. I learned about Sanity.io and it's
combination with Hydrogen for setting up a storefront with Shopify. Don't expect
to pick up everything there is to learn about the technologies during the
workshop, but you'll get some exposure to something you can dig into later on!

I never realized how _easy_ it was to get going with Shopify and creating my own
e-commerce store prior to this workshop

### The Talks

Not a bad talk among the bunch. The emcees were f\*cking great They really set
the tone + vibe for the whole event. The playful banter between Marc and
Madisson was hilarious

Kent's keynote set the spirit for the conference: He gave us examples of why the
web is great it's permissionless, the web doesn't break, and most importantly,
the web is you (us); a melting pot of ideas. It doesn't matter what you're
using... there's a place for you!

Highlight of things I learned (high level so I can justify work paying) Una's
talk about CSS and HTML showed me just how far the platform had gotten. Very
soon, we'll be able to ship native select elements that we can easily style (no
more having to create div soup to get a nice looking UI for selects)! Another
thing from this talk which was dope was scroll driven animations; I'm already
using it on my site! Moving away from JS driven scroll events to CSS will help
unblock the JS thread and improve the perf of our sites! Popover's are also
coming our way... so dope; my brain melted.

Every click is an interaction but not every interaction will be a click
aria-current="page". inert.

"Three elements to a talk; to inform, to educate, and to entertain; in my
experience, the most entertaining talks are the most important"

### The Afterparty

Don't skip the mother effing after party! It's so much fun and it'll help
solidify some of the relationships you helped create earlier on in the day. It's
super low pressure, everyone's just happy to be there, and if you're lucky,
there's fun games and karaoke!

I regret leaving as early as I did from the after party. Yes I was tired. Yes,
my social battery was running on empty. Yes, I missed home... but also, when is
the next time I'm gonna be in the same room as those wonderful folks again?
Probably not until next year... üò¢.

## Closing Thoughts

My time in web dev is up in the air. AI might take over, I might switch out of
the industry, I might open up a hot dog stand? Who knows! However, I won't
forget the fun times I had at Epic web conf. I truly hope I get to go back next
year.
