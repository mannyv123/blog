I somehow stumbled across this interesting book <NumbersLink /> while preparing
for a couple of coding interviews... and yes, <NumbersLink /> is the motivation for this blog post (if you haven't guessed ðŸ˜œ).

Similar to my approach to <TextLink href="../7-canadian-mortgages/">Mortgages in Canada</TextLink>, I'm going to provide some of my key take-aways as I've just finished reading the material and it's still fresh in my mind.
I can't recommend it enough, but if you're looking for a quick reference (talking to you, Future Taran ðŸ˜†), I'd suggest starting here.

## The Two Modes Of Thinking

Innantely, at a biological level, we know that there are certain kinds of thinking/states of being that we're able to situationally enter.
But what are these patterns of thinking? Can I tap into them at will? What are the benefits of one type of thinking over another? I've pondered these questions for a bit
and I've learned, throughout my 28 years on this earth, that I'm either thinking freely and creatively about a problem or I'm
thinking narrowly, or as others have referred to it, thinking in a "flow" state where I'm completely immersed in what I'm doing and the task at hand.

<NumbersLink /> describes these two modes of thinking as <TextLink href="#diffuse-mode">
  Diffuse Mode
</TextLink> and <TextLink href="#focus-mode">Focus mode</TextLink> respectively.

### Focus Mode

Referring to the above image, if we imagine our mind to be like a game of pinball, focus mode would be akin to a game in which
there are multiple crowded bumpers on the game area.

### Diffuse Mode

Sticking with the pinball analogy, then diffuse mode would be akin to a game in which there are a minimal amount of bumpers
for our pinball to hit; this means that the ball can travel quite a long path before hitting the next bumper and can traverse
in such a way that it can travel throughout the entire game area with minimal issue.

This is how diffuse mode operates. A thought (the pinball) is able to traverse a large portion of your
neural network and make connections that aren't necessarily straightforward. When we're facing a brand new problem that we haven't seen before,
or an enemy that we've never faced in battle, there's no existing neural pattern that we can lean on... we need to be flexible!

Diffuse mode allows for you to think in a "big picture" kind of way, grapple with new theories,
and apply previous experiences from different areas of your life to the problem you're working on or concept you're trying to understand.
