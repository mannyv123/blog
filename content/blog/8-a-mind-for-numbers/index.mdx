**Disclaimer: I don't really have issues with procrastination so I skipped that part**.

I somehow stumbled across this interesting book <NumbersLink /> while preparing
for a couple of coding interviews... and yes, <NumbersLink /> is the motivation for this blog post (if you haven't guessed ðŸ˜œ).

Similar to my approach to <TextLink href="../7-canadian-mortgages/">Mortgages in Canada</TextLink>, I'm going to provide some of my key take-aways as I've just finished reading the material and it's still fresh in my mind.
I can't recommend it enough, but if you're looking for a quick reference (talking to you, Future Taran ðŸ˜†), I'd suggest starting here.

## The Two Modes Of Thinking

Innantely, at a biological level, we know that there are certain kinds of thinking/states of being that we're able to situationally enter.
But what are these patterns of thinking? Can I tap into them at will? What are the benefits of one type of thinking over another? I've pondered these questions for a bit
and I've learned, throughout my 28 years on this earth, that I'm either thinking freely and creatively about a problem or I'm
thinking narrowly, or as others have referred to it, thinking in a "flow" state where I'm completely immersed in what I'm doing and the task at hand.

<NumbersLink /> describes these two modes of thinking as <TextLink href="#diffuse-mode">
  Diffuse Mode
</TextLink> and <TextLink href="#focus-mode">Focus mode</TextLink> respectively.

### Focus Mode

Referring to the above image, if we imagine our mind to be like a game of pinball, focus mode would be akin to a game in which
there are multiple crowded bumpers in the game area. A thought (the ball in our analogy) will be bounce off multiple bumpers in
a localized region. The closer bumpers are telling of the fact that we're able to focus more on a precise thought and therefore
concentrate on a problem/thought that we already have down pat at the concept level.

When we're focusing on something, the prefrontal cortex sends out signal that links neural pathways along the brain that
are related to what you're currently working on. When we first approach a problem, we utilize approach the problem with
the focus mode switched on. We read the text, look over notes, scower Google for an answer, think back to previous
problems we've faced in the area and attempt to utilize past experience and patterns to solve the problem. This is generally
great, but for problems where changing one variable or some key details drastically change the approach and/or solution,
relying on focus mode becomes problematic.

When dealing with subject matter which employs abstract concepts, focus mode becomes more effortful. An example of an abstract concept would be
the idea of love. We try our best to define it with words, display it with our actions, but it is not physically possible to
point at an object and say "that is love" -- there's no real life model. Don't come at me with some BS about how
you "love" your friends and family. Bitch, I can't point to that and say objectively that that is love ðŸ¤£. In the world of computer science
the idea of a stack is also an abstract concept.... there's no real life model of a "stack" where someone is popping and pushing
stuff onto it. Before you come at me with the whole stack of pancakes analogy, I'm not saying pancake stacks are not real,
but a stack in computer science is an **abstract** data type. IT'S IN THE NAME!

Another related problem to subject matter which employs abstract concepts is the **Einstellung** effect (pronounced "EYE-stellung").
Basically, this means that you'll focus on your initial thought so much so that you won't be able to see better more elegant solutions.
The difference between a master and the student is that the master will spend, on average, more time attempting to understand the context
regarding a problem/issue before trying to jump into creating a solution. The student will jump right into trying to find solution without
allowing themselves the time needed to truly comprehend what they're looking at.

Don't fuck yourself over by jumping straight into solving a problem. Think about it. Allow yourself the time to ruminate. Play around.

### Diffuse Mode

Sticking with the pinball analogy, then diffuse mode would be akin to a game in which there are a minimal amount of bumpers
for our pinball to hit; this means that the ball can travel quite a long path before hitting the next bumper and can traverse
in such a way that it can travel throughout the entire game area with minimal issue.

This is how diffuse mode operates. A thought (the pinball) is able to traverse a large portion of your
neural network and make connections that aren't necessarily straightforward. When we're facing a brand new problem that we haven't seen before,
or an enemy that we've never faced in battle, there's no existing neural pattern that we can lean on... we need to be flexible!

Diffuse mode allows for you to think in a "big picture" kind of way, grapple with new theories,
and apply previous experiences from different areas of your life to the problem you're working on or concept you're trying to understand.
This is why procrastination is such a bitch. Not only are you stressing yourself out by not doing the work but the act of
putting off doing the work is robbing you of the time that you'd normally use to enter diffuse mode thinking and exploration
because you just have to finish whatever the hell it is that you need to finish.

Diffuse mode is also great for another reason... it does work in the background for you! Have you ever been working through a difficult
problem for hours on end to eventually hit a wall and get stumped to only arrive at the exact solution you were searching for
while doing something mundane like cleaning your car or going for a walk? Well, baby, that was diffuse mode working in the background.

Moreover, diffuse mode is how we learn at deep and creative levels. When we're
hyper focused, it becomes very difficult for us to see the forest, we're too
preoccupied with the trees. How are you supposed to internalize a tree data
structure when you're too focused on how you want to go about creating the nodes
and how best to link them. Before you jump into an implementation, it just makes
more sense to understand the big picture and the overall goal.

In a nutshell, that's diffuse mode and it's fucking marvelous. Like Bruce Lee said, **all knowledge is self knowledge**.

## Accessing the two modes and how to best learn

It's all well and good to know what these two modes are so that you could impress your friends and family, but
I'm all about practicality. It does me little good to know about these two modes and not know how to actively employ them
in my life.
